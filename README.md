# Rewrite
This project is currently going under a rewrite. If you want to do any changes or PRing, please do so on the new dev branch.

## ü§î How can I add her?

If you want to use NoManaRPG on your server, you can add our public instance by [clicking here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=732598033962762402&permissions=388160&scope=bot)! We recommend using the public instance, after all, more than 40 guilds already use, trust and love her, so why not try it out?

You can also host NoManaRPG yourself, however we won't give support for people that are trying to selfhost her, we don't want to spend hours trying to troubleshoot other people issues that only happens on selfhosted instances, so you should at least know how to troubleshoot issues, if you find any.


## üöÄ Selfhosting NoManaRPG (Discord)

### üìú Selfhosting conditions and warnings
If you are planning to selfhost NoManaRPG, here are some stuff that you should keep in mind...
1. We keep the source code open so people can see, learn and be inspired by how NoManaRPG was made and, if they want to, they can help the project with features and bug fixes.
2. This is a community project, if you make changes to NoManaRPG's source code you need to follow the [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE) and keep the changes open source! And, if you want to help NoManaRPG, why not create a pull request? üòâ
3. We **won't** give support for selfhosted instances, you need to know how to troubleshoot the issues yourself. We tried to make the selfhost process as painless as possible, but it is impossible to know all the different issues you may find.
4. Don't lie saying that you "created NoManaRPG". Please give credits to the creators!
5. NoManaRPG requires a lot of different API keys for a lot of features. While they aren't required, you may encounter issues when trying to use some of the features.
6. NoManaRPG's assets (fonts, images, etc) aren't not distributed with the source code, you will need to create and include your own assets.
7. We use Ubuntu 18.04 to run her, she may work on other Linux operating systems or even in Windows, but we recommend hosting her on Ubuntu!
8. To avoid problems and confusions, we **do not allow** using the name "NoManaRPG", "ClastRPG" or any similar names on your selfhosted versions. Call her "Nii RPG" if you aren't creative enough to create your own name to give to your selfhosted version. Don't like "Nii RPG"? Generate your own [here](https://www.behindthename.com/random/)!
